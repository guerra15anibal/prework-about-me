    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
<p>Cudi is also an advocate for mental health issues, suffering from some himself like depression and anxiety, yet he pushes forward and pursues his passion. This is the main reason I enjoy Kid Cudi's music. Remember there is always someone out there will to give a helping hand.
